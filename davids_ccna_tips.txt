# Courtesy of my friend, David W.

-Recommends Cisco Press, CCNA 200-301 official cert guide library; 

-Does NOT recommend network simulator library (perhaps because we both 
already have access to Cisco simulators through our training program?

-CCNA Udemy, Neil Anderson; didn't watch most videos, comes with zip file for
flash cards;

-David mostly did the labs, including the ones from the Udemy course;

-Packet Tracer is important!

-Recommends EtherChannel, also Port Security;

-Also DHCP snooping, Dynamic ARP inspection, Load Balancing, some ACLs on test,
not a lot;

-Subnetting, BGP maybe?, RIP is not really in test; VLANs yes!

-VLAN.dat file, where is it stored? What happens if you delete?

-Set up EtherChannel, configure for trunking; log into Port interface; 
-configure VLAN tagging, native VLAN, neighbor relations;

-DR, BDR, Link state database;

-STP

-Root bridge, some security;

-NTP, one or two questions but no practical;

-AAA, TACACS+, HSRP/VRRP; Layer 3 switching;

-IPv6, you have to know quite a bit!

-QoS, how to make network prioritize certain traffic over others;

-VoIP, PoE, Next-Generation Firewalls;

-Network controllers, DNA; network topology architectures;

-IPv6 address & prefix; EUI 64;

-A small amount of virtualization;

-Configure ports on a switch for voice using Switchport!

-use 'help' on Cisco IOS;

-3 to 4 labs/simulations on exam, do as much as you can, you'll get credit
as long as you run 'copy runn start';

-CDP & LLDP, learn to tell them apart;

-Port states;

-Subnetting and reading command output is most of the exam!

-Which IP config would work in this situation?

-Network topologies, wireless architectures, use Packet Tracer!

-Wireless devices have a GUI, learn the GUI!

-Configure and verify static IPv4 and IPv6 routing;

-Lots of reading command output and config files;

-Get good at going through LONG command outputs, and fast!

-NAT, DHCP, DNS, L3 switching; define scope, designate interface;

-A bit of SNMP; forward PHB for QoS class, marking, queue, congestion,
policing, shaping;

-Set up SSH keys, domain name, etc.

-WPA2, not sure about WPA3;

-Almost nothing about automation and programmability;

-Cisco DNA center;

-DON'T GET CISCO PRESS LABS (David and I have access to Cisco VMs);

-Packet Tracer, Neil Anderson labs;

-Once you submit an answer, you can't go back (unlike Network+?);

-Test is pass-fail, no minimum score for each section;
